        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
            It defines the content and structure of web content.
            It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
